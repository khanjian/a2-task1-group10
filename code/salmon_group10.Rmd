This report details adult fish passage for Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead salmon at the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River in Oregon from 2001-01-01 to 2010-12-31. Note that the Willamette Falls fish ladder was not operational on the following dates:  

* 2005-11-29 to 2005-12-01, 2005-12-06 to 2005-12-08, 2005-12-13 to 2005-12-14  
* 2008-08-26 to 2008-09-21  
* 2010-08-23 to 2010-08-27  

This report includes is a time series of adult salmon passage, seasonplots of passage, and annual totals  of passage for each species.


The data used in this report was accessed from  [Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time)](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_graph_text).  Columbia River DART is a data resource compiling information relating to the Columbia Basin salmon populations and environmental river conditions from federal, state, and tribal databases.

## Original time series 

```{r,  fig.cap = "**Figure 1**. Time series of adult passage for Coho (teal), Jack Coho (magenta), and Steelhead (orange) salmon at Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River, Oregon between 2001-2010. Data: Columbia River DART. 2021."}

fish_labels <- c("Coho", "Jack Coho", "Steelhead")
names(fish_labels) <- c("coho", "jack_coho", "steelhead")
  
ggplot(data = fish_ts, 
       aes(x = date, 
           y = count,
           title = )) +
  geom_line(aes(color = species)) +
  facet_wrap(~species, 
             scales = "free_y",
             labeller = labeller(species = fish_labels)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("cadetblue4", "mediumvioletred", "orange")) +
  labs(x = "\nYear",
       y = "Adult Salmon Count\n") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

- Coho salmon passage fluctuated between lower and higher counts every couple years before greatly increasing in 2009-2010, doubling in counts from 2008. 
- Jack coho salmon passage was the lowest out of the three species, with very low counts in 2007 before reaching a peak at the end of 2008. They also fluctuated between lower and higher counts every few years. 
- Steelhead salmon passage remained relatively stable between 2001-2010.


## Seasonplots

```{r}
fish_month <- fish_ts %>% 
  group_by_key() %>% 
  index_by(yr_mo = ~yearmonth(.)) %>% # index by month to make seasonality clearer
  summarise(monthly_mean_count = mean(count, na.rm = TRUE))

fish_month %>% 
  gg_season(y = monthly_mean_count) +
  labs(x = "Month",
       y = "Mean monthly count", 
       title = "Average monthly count of adult fish passage for Willamette fish ladder") +
  theme_minimal()
             
```
